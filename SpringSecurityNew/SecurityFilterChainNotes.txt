client sends request
and request passes on to the series of filter
where one filter acts as a delegation filter and delegates filter to securityfilterchain
from where the authenticationFilter checks with the Securitycontextholder (authentication principal and authorities)
from there it goes to authentication manager where the providerManager gives authentication
from there to authenticationProvider then to UserDetailsService then to UserDetails then to User then finally to DB
Back from DB to user to userdetails to userdetailsservice
to authenticationprovider
to authentication manager
to authentication filter
back to securitychainfilter

Common Security filter chains are:
UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter
BasicAuthenticationFilter
Oauth2LoginAuthenticationFilter


in WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter we have to manually override Filter method 
and extract data from claimsJws
but in securityFilterChain, the method is available handy
